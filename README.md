Rate-A-Cat is an app that allows you to determine whether random cat gifs are adorable or lame.

This app was built using a Mongo database, Mongoose, Express, and JavaScript.

Initially, the plan was to have people vote on two different cat gifs, but during development, I decided to use just one image and turn it into a "Hot or Not" but with cat gifs.
